This document describes the *public* vision, strategy and roadmap of CollectivAI.  
Detailed financial planning, internal tactics and personal data are intentionally **not** included here.

## 1. Vision & Mission

### Vision

By 2030, CollectivAI aims to become a **Sovereign Public AI Network for Europe** –  
a democratic, transparent and human-centered AI layer that supports citizens,  
institutions and researchers while respecting fundamental rights and European values.

### Mission

CollectivAI’s mission is to:

- Strengthen **democracy** and civic participation  
- Stabilise **economy and geopolitics** through better decision support  
- Accelerate **science, research, climate & environmental goals**  
- Improve quality of life while protecting **human dignity and privacy**  
- Build a **European AI infrastructure** that is open, trustworthy and sovereign


### Core Values

- **Human-Centered** – Technology serves people, not the other way around  
- **Democratic** – Citizens, experts and institutions participate in governance  
- **Transparent** – Models, policies and decisions are explainable and auditable  
- **Sovereign** – European infrastructure and compliance as a first-class goal  
- **Ethical & Secure** – Strong focus on privacy, security and AI ethics


---

## 2. Problem & Opportunity

### 2.1 Current Problems

1. **Fragmented AI Landscape**  
   Users juggle multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, local models, etc.),  
   each with different UIs, logins, policies and capabilities.

2. **Lack of European AI Sovereignty**  
   Most core AI services are operated by non-European big-tech providers.  
   Public institutions and organisations look for sovereign, GDPR-compliant alternatives.

3. **Missing Democratic Governance**  
   AI systems are rarely co-designed with citizens and public institutions.  
   Trust is low, fears about misuse and bias are high.

4. **Complexity for Organisations**  
   Public sector, research institutions, NGOs and SMEs struggle to understand:
   - Which models fit which use cases?
   - How to integrate AI safely, ethically and cost-efficiently?
   - How to stay compliant with GDPR and AI regulation in Europe?

### 2.2 Market Opportunity

- **Region:** Europe, with a strong focus on the wider European region  
- **Key Segments:**
  - Public administrations and government agencies  
  - Universities and research institutions  
  - NGOs, foundations, think tanks and civic-tech actors  
  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)  
  - Power users, developers and open-source communities  

There is a clear gap for a **democratically governed, open, European AI infrastructure** that is simple to use and simple to integrate.

## 3. Solution Overview

### 3.1 The CollectivAI App

**Tagline:** *One interface – many AI backends.*

The CollectivAI App is a unified interface that routes user requests to the most suitable AI backend, based on task type, policy and user preferences.

**Core Features:**

1. **Multi-Backend Routing**
   - Connects to various AI providers and models:  
     commercial APIs (e.g. GPT, Gemini, etc.), open models and local runtimes.
   - Automatically chooses the “best fit” backend for:
     - Coding, research, policy analysis, legal reasoning, climate/science support, etc.
   - Makes provider choice **transparent** to the user.

2. **Ethics & Privacy Layer**
   - Configurable policies for:
     - Sensitive topics, disinformation, hate speech, bias reduction.
   - Supports different **privacy modes**, for example:
     - *Max Privacy* – prioritise local or self-hosted models  
     - *Balanced* – hybrid of local and cloud models  
     - *Performance* – strongest models with clear transparency about data use
   - Logging & auditing options for institutions (where appropriate and lawful).

3. **Unified UI / UX**
   - Clean, accessible chat-style interface (desktop & mobile).  
   - Multi-tab workspaces for different tasks (research, code, drafting, analysis).  
   - Clear “About / Explainability” views:
     - which model was used  
     - why it was chosen  
     - which policies were applied

### 3.2 CollectivAI as Infrastructure

Beyond the app, CollectivAI is an **AI infrastructure layer**:

- **APIs & SDKs**  
  - Allow organisations to integrate CollectivAI’s routing and policy engine into:
    - internal tools
    - portals and civic platforms
    - research environments

- **Governance Layer**  
  - Long-term goal: a democratic governance model involving:
    - citizens
    - experts and researchers
    - public institutions and civil society
  - Governance defines policies, transparency standards and accountability rules.

- **Sovereign Public AI Network (2030)**  
  - A network of trustworthy AI nodes (e.g. university datacenters, public clouds, sovereign hosting providers) forming a **European AI utility layer**.

- **Accountability** – clear responsibilities and escalation paths.  

### 7.2 Governance Roadmap (Conceptual)

1. **Initial Phase**
   - Core maintainers define baseline policies and architecture.
   - Public documentation and community feedback channels.

2. **Advisory & Expert Groups**
   - Involve external experts (AI ethics, law, security, civic-tech).
   - Formalise review processes for key decisions.

3. **Democratic Participation**
   - Pilot mechanisms for:
     - community feedback and voting  
     - advisory assemblies for significant policy changes  
   - Explore models that align with democratic principles in Europe.

4. **Institutional Integration**
   - Work with public and civic institutions to align governance structures with:
     - legal frameworks  
     - democratic norms
